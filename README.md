# Prescription_label_reading

##Extract the textual information from the prescriptions and convert it to speech.

##Supporting elderly or vulnerable patients should be a priority for many enterprises. This is notably true for health care professionals. Enabling voice messages can facilitate elderly individuals' comprehension of your message. Text-to-Speech can give you peace of mind by enabling you to provide superior service. You could even send voice messages that read prescription labelling, for instance. This can be a true challenge for anyone with reading difficulties, not to mention the elderly and visually impaired. A label that speaks and is sent directly to your device makes it simple to learn everything about your medication. Additionally, dosage data can be monitored and shared with carers.


##You must use OCR techniques to extract text information from the prescriptions and convert it to speech.
